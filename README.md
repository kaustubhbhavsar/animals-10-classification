<!-- ABOUT PROJECT -->
## What Is It?
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10">Animals-10</a> is an image dataset with 10 output classes, i.e., 10 classes of 10 different animals. According to the information given by the dataset provider, the data is collected from Google Images and verified by a human. The dataset contains around 26,000 images.

<b>Challenges:</b>

1.  Classifying 26,000 images into 10 classes results in fewer images per category.

2.  The dataset is imbalanced, i.e., few categories have a large number of images compared to others.

3.  Images are varying in size and medium in quality.


> <b>Aim of the project is to handle class imbalance and perform multiclass image classification.</b>
